## Overview

This project showcases a basic implementation of a client connecting to a server using Python's `socket` library. The example connects to GitHub's server and prints a success message upon establishing the connection.

## Features

- Demonstrates basic socket creation
- Resolves the hostname to an IP address
- Connects to a remote server using TCP

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Networking:** `socket` library

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/client-server-connection.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd client-server-connection
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Python script to create a socket, resolve GitHub's hostname, and establish a connection:

    ```bash
    python client_server_connection.py
    ```

2. Upon successful connection, you will see the following output:

    ```bash
    socket successfully created!
    Socket has successfully connected to Github on port == <GitHub IP>
    ```
